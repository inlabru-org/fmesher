Description: Functions that generate planar and spherical triangle meshes,
    computes finite element calculations for 1- and 2-dimensional manifolds,
    functions for lines and polygons, and transparent handling of crs information
    and interoperability with sf and sp geometries. Experimental
    package that will take over these features from the INLA package.
